"""
team_scraper scrapes and stores team stats from basketball reference.

By default, it scrapes miscellaneous stats from 2019. Alternate years and tables may be scraped though functionality is
not yet guaranteed. The scraped tables are written to the specified database.

ToDo:
    1. Create a method for stripping extraneous characters from team-names. If querying a historical season (<2001),
    the teams that made the playoffs have a '*' appended that we want to strip from the team-name
